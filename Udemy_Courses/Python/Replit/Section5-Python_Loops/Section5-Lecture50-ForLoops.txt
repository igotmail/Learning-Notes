# Lecture 50: Using the For Loop with Python Lists

# You can think of writing a for loop like this:
# for each [item] in [list_of_items]:
#  Do something for each item

# Basic example: "fruit" is a local variable that is updated with each loop/iteration of the for loop
fruits = ["apple", "peach", "pear"]
for fruit in fruits:
  print(fruit)
  # Prints out the index of each element, adds 1 to the index, and then prints out the element
  print(f"{fruits.index(fruit) + 1}) {fruit}")

# We can execute the same line of code multiple times - this is a huge benefit with loops

# It is good practice to name the local variable of the for loop the singular version of whatever you are iterating through
# For example, the singular form of fruits is fruit
