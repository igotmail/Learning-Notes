for number in range(1, 16):
  # Problem: Logcial operator is or, needs to be and
  # if number % 3 == 0 or number % 5 == 0:
  if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
  # if number % 3 == 0: 
  elif number % 3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
  # Problem: This if - else block is being handled as a separate unit. Meaning, if this condition is not met, then the program will print the number even if "FizzBuzz", "Fizz", or "Buzz" has already taken place of the number itself. This if else block is why the number is printed even if these phrases are printed 
  # if number % 5 == 0:
  elif number % 5 == 0:
    print("Buzz")
  else:
    # Problem: Remove brackets from the print statement
    print(number)

# Problems:
# 1) Program is printing FizzBuzz, Buzz, and Fizz for appropriate numbers but it is still printing those numbers anyway. The goal is to print these phrases in place of these numbers.
# The reason why this is happening is:
# 1.1) The third if statment is combined with the else block. If the number is 3, the remainder of 3 / 5 will of course not be 0. However, since that if block was evaluated to be false, the else block will then print the number 3 even after the program as printed "Fizz" in the previous if statement.
# Re-writing the 2nd and 3rd If statements to elif statements fixes this problem. The reason why it fixes the problem is that each if - elif statement is evaluated first before the else block is executed. If one of those coniditions are true, then the program stops, it doesn't continue to the else block.
