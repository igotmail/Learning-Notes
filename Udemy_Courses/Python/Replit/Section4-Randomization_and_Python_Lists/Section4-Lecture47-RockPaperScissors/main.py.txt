# This program emulates a game of rock, paper, scissors with a computer

# 1) Import the random module as we will use the randint() function
# Importing tie for the recursive tie() function in case both players make the same choice - the game will continue until there is a winner
import random
import tie

# 2) Create a list of strings that holds the options for "rock", "paper", and "scissors"
gameChoice = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]

# 3) Capture user input
playerInput = input("What do you choose?: Rock, Paper, or Scissors? ").lower()
# Capitalizing the 1st letter of the player's choice and then adding the rest of the characters to the capitalized letter - You can also just use .title() to capitalize the first letter of the string
print("Player chose: " + playerInput[0].upper() + playerInput[1:len(playerInput)])

# 3.1) Print Ascii art of the player's choice
if playerInput == "rock":
  print('''

---'   ____)
      (_____)
      (_____)

''')

# 4) Capture the oppenents (computer's) input
compInput = gameChoice[random.randint(0,2)]
# Upper casing the 1st letter of the opponent's choice and then adding the rest of the characters to the upper cased letter - You can also just use .title() to capitalize the first letter of the string
