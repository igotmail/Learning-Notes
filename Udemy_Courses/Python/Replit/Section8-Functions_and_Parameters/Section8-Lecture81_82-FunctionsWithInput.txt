# Lecture 81: Functions with Input

# Remember that Functions are useful because they allow programmers to develop a set of instructions that can be executed repeatedly. You do not need to continuously write the same code over and over again. Functions eliminate redundancy.

# Refer to Section6-Lecture59+60-Functions to refresh on the basics of functions: https://replit.com/@igotmail/Section6-Lecture5960-Functions#main.py

# Greet Function Example:
def greet():
  print("Hello!")
  print("How are you?")
  print("Skibbidybopmmbada")

# Calling greet()
greet()

print("======================================================= ")

print("Function that allows for input: \n")

# When a parameter is introduced to a function, Python first instatiates the function, finds where it's been called, finds the function, and then pass whatever information (argument) into the function's parameter 

# Greet2 with parameters - name, and time_of_day
def greet2(name, time_of_day):
  print("Hello, " + name + "!")
  print(f"How are you this {time_of_day}?")
  print("Skibbidybopmmbada")

# Calling greet2() with arguments - "Bobby" and "afternoon"
greet2("Bobby", "afternoon")

print("======================================================= ")

# Lecture 82: Positional vs. Keyword Arguments

# - Key takeaways: 
# Positional Arguments
# Keyword Arguments

print("Additional function 'greet3' that allows for 3 parameters \n")

# Greet3 with parameters - name, location, hobby
def greet3(name, location, hobby):
  print(f"Hello, {name}")
  print(f"You are in {location}")
  print(f"You like to {hobby}")

# Calling greet3() with arguments - "Jeff", "Jeffery Land", and "Jeff"
greet3("Jeff", "Jeffery Land", "Joff")
print("----------------")

# Keep in mind that the 1st argument will be assigned to the 1st paramter
# name = "Jeff", location = "Jeffery Land", hobby = "Joff"

# You can switch the position of these arguments and receive a different response. These are called positional arguments:
greet3("Joff", "Jeff", "Jeffery Land")
print("----------------")

# When we call the function, we haven't specified anywhere which particular parameter we want to associate these arguments to
# So Python looks at the position of these arguments and assigns them to the parameter based on their position when we call the function

# You can specify which argument goes to what parameter by using Keyword Arguments:
greet3(name = "Bobby", location = "Bobby Land", hobby = "Bob")
print("----------------")

# You can also switch the positioning of the Keywords Arguments:
greet3(location = "Disney Worl", hobby = "Deep Sea Fish", name = "Vancouver")
