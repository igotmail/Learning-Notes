	It is good practice to create a branch (snapshot) of the main or master branch
		This allows you to work on the most up to date version of the source code without affecting the live version of the source code

	These terms are the same: 
		Version Control System (VCS)
		Source Code Management (SCM)
		Revision Control System (RCS)

	Benefits of Version Control Systems: 
		1) Attributable changes - Every change that’s made can be attributed to a team member. 
		2) In-depth tracking makes reverting easy - Because every change is tracked, even the very small ones, it’s easy to revert to an earlier version if needed
			As you can imagine, this is a much-needed feature in software development
		3) Better organization and communication - Commit messages, messages you send to the team detailing why you made a change, facilitate good communication between team members 
			They also make it a lot easier if you forget what changes you made in the past!
		4) Concurrency - In software projects, developers make plenty of changes to the source code
			Usually, there are numerous developers working on different things
			One might be tweaking existing code for better security while another is working on a new feature
			Git enables these developers to work concurrently while helping to prevent any conflict between each developer’s changes
		5) Branching and merging - Team members can create separate branches to work on the project and then merge their changes with the main branch. Branches are temporary and can be deleted after a merge.

	Other VCS: 
		- Fossil
		- Mercurial
		- Subversion
