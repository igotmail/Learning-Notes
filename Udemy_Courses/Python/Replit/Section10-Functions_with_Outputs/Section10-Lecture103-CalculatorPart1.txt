# Calculator

# 1) Create 4 functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

# Add Function:
def add(n1, n2):
  return n1 + n2

# Subtract Function:
def substract(n1, n2):
  return n1 - n2

# Multiplication Function:
def multiply(n1, n2):
  return n1 * n2

# Division Function:
def divide(n1, n2):
  return n1 / n2

# 2) Create a dictionary that holds the functions as values and the mathematical operators as keys
# Notice that we don't include the function's parenthesis "()"
# We will use a variable to capture a user's input for the mathematical operator, and then use another variable to capture which function we will want to use for our calculations
operations = {
  "+": add,
  "-": substract,
  "*": multiply,
  "/": divide,
}

# 3) Ask for the user's first number
num1 = int(input("What is the first number?: "))

# 4) Display the types of operators the user could use using a for loop
for operator in operations:
  print(operator)

# 5) Ask which operator symbol the user will use
operator_symbol = input("Which operator would you like to use?: ")

# 6) Ask for the user's second number
num2 = int(input("What is the second number?: "))

# 7) Use the value for operator_symbol to call the key in the dictionary and store it in a variable - the variable will dynamically store the function based on the user's choice 
calculation_function = operations[operator_symbol]

# 8) Store the result of the function's calculation
answer = calculation_function(num1, num2)

# 9) Print out the equation and the result
print(f"{num1} {operator_symbol} {num2} = {answer}")
