#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 0.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
print("Welcome to the tip calculator \n")

# 1) Receive input for the total bill
totalBill = float(input("What was the total bill?: "))

# 2) Receive input for the percentage tip you would like to give
percentTip = input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10%, 12% or 15%? ")
percentTip = float(percentTip) / 100

# Refactoring - include both percentTip assignments in one line
# percentTip = float(input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10%, 12%, or 15%? ")) / 100

# 3) Receive input for how many people should split the bill
billSplit = int(input("How many people are splitting the bill? "))

# 4) Using all of the inputs gathered, calculate how much each person should pay

# 4.1) totalBill * percentTip + totalBill = billTip (Gives us the tip added to the total bill)
billTip = totalBill * percentTip + totalBill

# 4.2) billTip / billSplit = personPay (Gives us how much each person should pay for the bill) - Round to the nearest hundredths place
personPay = round(billTip / billSplit, 2)

# 5) Print out the results
print(f"Each person should pay: ${personPay}")
print("{:.2f}".format(personPay))
