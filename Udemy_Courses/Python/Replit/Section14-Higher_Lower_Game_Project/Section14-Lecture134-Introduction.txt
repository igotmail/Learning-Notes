# Lecture 134: Introdcution & Program Requirements for the Higher Lower Game

# Here we discuss what we can to do organize our thoughts and ideas to make the Higher Lower game

# 1) Breakdown the Problem
# Take the problem as a whole and break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks

# 2) Start with the easiest problem
# When you have your list of tasks ready, start with what you think is the easier to complete

# 3) For each task, write them as comments in your code
# Organize each task as comments in your IDE. Once you're ready, begin knocking out each task one at a time

# 4) Write code, run code, fix code
# With each task, complete writing your code and then run it. If the code is working as intended, then you have completed each task. 
# Pausing after you've written code for each task is a vital part of making sure that you do not run into any bugs later on in your program

# Breakdown problem - Small task - Organize task - Work on small task - Revise if needed and repeat
