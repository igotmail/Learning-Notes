# The input() function can receive data entered by the user:
input("What's your favorite color? \n")

# You can nest the input() function in a print() function - The input() function will be executed first
print("Hello " + input("What's your name? "))

# The value you enter for the input() function will be printed in the console
# print(input("How are you?")) -> Input given: Good -> print("Good")
