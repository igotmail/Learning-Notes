coordinates = list(position)

# 1.1) Converting column and row to integers to avoid the TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str error
# 1.2) Remember to subtract 1 from column and row as lists are 0 based (User input -> 11 = map[0][0])
column = int(coordinates[0]) - 1
row = int(coordinates[1]) - 1

# 2) Update the map list by replacing the specified element from the lists with 'X'
# 2.1) Remember that the map list is printed like this [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]] - Visualizing the list helps to know where you need to use the 'row' and 'column' variables
map[row][column] = 'X'

# Refactoring:

# map[(int(coordinates[1]) - 1)][int(coordinates[0]) - 1] = 'X'
