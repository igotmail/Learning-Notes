# 1) Import the random module here
import random

# Split string method
names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, separated by a comma. ")
names = names_string.split(", ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

# 2) Use the len() function to dynamically determine how many names were entered and use the randint() function to print out a random name:
# Remember to add - 1 after len() to avoid an index out of bounds error -> [0, 1, 2, 3] -> len() will count 4 -> If 4 is selected, the program will throw an error
print(names[random.randint(0, len(names) - 1)] + " is going to buy the meal today!")
