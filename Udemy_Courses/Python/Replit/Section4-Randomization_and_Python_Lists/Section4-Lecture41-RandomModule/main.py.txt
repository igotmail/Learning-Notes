# RANDOM:

# Importing a Module/Library allows us to utilize the prebuilt functions located in this Module/Library
import random

# Generating a random integer between 1 and 10
print("Random Integer Number: ", random.randint(1, 10))

# Generating a random floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0
print("Random Floating Number: ", random.random())

# Expanding the random floating point number range 0.0 - 4.9
# Multiplying the result by a number will give us a larger range than 0.0 - 1.0 excluding the number that is used for multiplication
print("Float between 0.0 - 4.9: ", random.random() * 5)

# MODULES:
# Code can be split into different bits of functionality
# Modules help achieve that goal by allowing you to divide a larger script into smaller, more manageable code pieces.
# Modules encourage collaboration as you can split a larger program into smaller modules

# Here is an example of a file/script being imported into this program
# At the top left, you can see 'myModule.py' at the same level of main.py
# main.py is what will be executed when we run the program. So, we can bring in other files/scripts into this main.py file to run
import myModule

print(myModule.pi)
