Git From the Inside Out Notes: https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/two/git-from-the-inside-out

** Dan from TCS gave me this Article ** 

== Initialize the Repo ==
git init: Creates a .git directory and writes some files in it
	These files deinfe everything about the Git Configuration and the history of the project
	
== Add Some Files ==
printf 'a' > data/number.txt
git add [data/letter.txt]: This command has 2 effects
	1) It creates a new blob file in the .git/objects/ directory
		- This blob file contains the compressed content of the data/letter.txt
		- It's name is derived by hashing its content. 
		- Hashing a piece of text means running a program on it that turns it into a smaller piece of text that uniquely identifies the original
		- For example, the character "a" in letter.txt will be hased into something like 2e65efe2a145dda7ee51d1741299f848e5bf752e
		- The first 2 characters of the hash are used as the name of a direcotr inside the objects database: .git/objects/2e
		- The rest of the has is used as the name of the blob file that holds teh content of the added file: .git/objects/2e/65efe2a145dda7ee51d1741299f848e5bf752e
		- Just by using the add command, Git saves the letter.txt file into the objects directory
	2) git add adds the file to the index
		- The index is a list that contains every file taht Git has been told to keep track of
		- letter.txt is stored as a file at .get/index
		- Each line of the file maps a tracked file to the hash of its content at the member it was added
		- This is the index after the git add command is run: data/letter.txt 2e65efe2a145dda7ee51d1741299f848e5bf752e
		- So, we have an index entry that points to the blob of the letter.txt file

Add another file: (New Blob, Updated Index)
printf '1234' > data/number.txt
git add data/number.txt
	- This is the index after running git add for a second time:
		data/letter.txt 2e65efe2a145dda7ee51d1741299f848e5bf752e
		data/number.txt 274c0052dd5408f8ae2bc8440029ff67d79bc5c3
If a user wanted to update the number.txt file, they can use: printf '1' > data/number.txt
	- Then use git add number.txt
	- Adding the same file to the index again will create a new blob with the new content
	- It also updates the index entry for data/number.txt to point at the new blob
