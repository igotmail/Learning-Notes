# Data Types:

# Strings:
"Hello"
stringHello = "Hello"
# Subscripting a string by using the string's index values
print(stringHello[0])
# Keep in mind that Python's indexes are 0 based - the index will always start with 0
# print(stringHello[len(stringHello) - 1]) -> prints out o

# Integer (Whole Numbers):
50
numInt = 50
# Larger whole numbers can be declared with underscores in the commas space - These are used for easier readability for humans. The computer will ignore the underscores
123_456_789
print(123_456_789)  # Prints 123456789

# Floats (Fractional Numbers - Numbers with decimal places)
3.14159
numFloat = 3.14159
# We can think of the decimal point that can float between the number's numerical spaces:
314.159
3141.59
31415.9

# Boolean (True/False):
# These variables only have those 2 values - True or False
True
False
# You may see boolean variables start with the name "is":
isOn = True
isOff = False
