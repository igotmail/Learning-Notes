# Lecture 128 - Using a Debugger

# Steps to fix/clear/remove bugs:
# 6) Use a Debugger
# In lecture 123, we've saved a list of debugging tools:
# 1) Thonny - https://thonny.org/
# 2) Python Tutor - https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit
# 3) Python Debug Libraries - https://docs.python.org/3/library/debug.html
# Debuggers can enhance the 3rd step of fixing bugs (Evaluate Each Line) because they allow you to continue through a program step by step showing you the information that is captured in each variable.
# This slows the execution process of the program so that it's much easier to understand and pick a part the issues that may lie within your code
# Don't forget that you can use breakpoints - line 14. You can place these anywhere in the code, particularly on lines that you think are running into an issue.

# Use a Debugger:
def mutate(a_list):
  b_list = []
  for item in a_list:
    new_item = item * 2
    print(new_item) # <- Used the print statement to see what new_item was
  # Before:
  # b_list.append(new_item)
  # print(b_list)
  # After:
    b_list.append(new_item)
  print(b_list)

mutate([1,2])

# What is the for loop doing? - The for loop is retrieving each element from a_list and multiplying that element by 2. The new_item variable is then being assigned the result of that calculation

# When will the variable new_item be added to b_list? - The new_item variable will be added to b_list once the for loop has completed its final iteration. Once that is done, the new_item variable will be assigned the result of the last element of a_list multipled by 2. It will only be single number.

# What are you assumptions about the append statement for b_list. At first, b_list seems like it would receive each assigned element that new_item gets. However, the append statement is indented outside of the for loop. The for loop has no jurisdiction over it. Because of this, only when the for loop is finished iterating through a_list will the new_item variable be appended to b_list.

# You can fix this by moving the append statement in for loop block
