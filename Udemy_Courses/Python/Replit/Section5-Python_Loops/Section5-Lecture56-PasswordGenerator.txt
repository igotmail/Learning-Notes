# 1) Import the random module/library
import random

# 2) Create a characters list and a password string that will be updated later on 
# Lists are mutable/changeable, strings are immutable/not changeable. We'll modify the characters list first and then add its contents to the password string
characters = []
password = ""

# 3) Create 3 strings that contain letters, symbols, and numbers for the characters list
letters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
symbols = "~!@#$%^&*()_-+={}[]|"
numbers = "1234567890"

# 4) Create a print statement welcoming the user
print("Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!")

# 5) Create an Input statement asking the user how many letters they'd like in their password 
num_of_letters = int(input("How many letters would you like in your password? \n"))

# 6) Use a for loop to append a random character from the letters string into the characters list
for letter in range(0, num_of_letters):
  characters.append(letters[random.randint(0, len(letters) - 1)])
# print(characters)

# 7) Create an Input statement asking the user how many symbols they'd like in their password
num_of_symbols = int(input("How many symbols would you like? \n"))

# 8) Use a for loop to append a random character from the symbols string into the characters list
for symbol in range(0, num_of_symbols):
  characters.append(symbols[random.randint(0, len(symbols) - 1)])
# print(characters)

# 9) Create an Input statement asking the user how many numbers they'd like in their password
num_of_numbers = int(input("How many numbers would you like? \n"))

# 10) Use a for loop to append a random character from the numbers string into the characters list
for number in range(0, num_of_numbers):
  characters.append(numbers[random.randint(0, len(numbers) - 1)])
# print(characters)

# 11) Use the shuffle() function from the random module/library to rearrange the characters in the password list
random.shuffle(characters)
# print(characters)

# 12) Use a for loop to add each characters from the characters list to a password string
for char in characters:
  password += char
print("Here is your password: " + password)

# Professor's solution:

# for letter in range(0, num_of_letters):
#   characters += random.choice(letters)

# for symbol in range(0, num_of_symbols):
#   characters += random.choice(symbols)

# for number in range(0, num_of_numbers):
#   characters += random.choice(numbers)

# random.shuffle(characters)

# for char in characters:
#   password += char

# print("Here is your password: " + password)
