# I didn't use any lists in this program to challenge myself. I only wanted to use dictionaries.

# Links that helped me complete this program:
# In add_new_auctioneer function: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp
# Step 4: https://www.askpython.com/python/string/python-string-substring
# Step 5: https://pythonguides.com/python-format-number-with-commas/

# Keep in mind that I added more variables as I worked, I initially thought that I just needed the dictionary variable and didn't know that I needed to add these variables until I developed more of the program
# 1) Initilize the following: 
  # 1.1) An empty dictionary
  # 1.2) A boolean variable for the while loop
  # 1.3) An integer variable to count the number of auctioneers in the auction
  # 1.4) An integer variable to capture the highest bid 
  # 1.5) A string to capture the auction's winner
auction_participants = {}
is_finished = False
user_count = 1
highest_bid = 0
bid_winner = ""

# This dictionary updates the auction_participants dictionary in step 3.2
def add_new_auctioneer(auctioneer, bid_amount):
  new_dictionary = {
    # I add a number to each key because the keys need to be unique otherwise the information would simply be overwritten (https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp)
    # Dictionaries do not allow duplicate keys
    "user" + str(user_count): auctioneer,
    "bid" + str(user_count): bid_amount,
  }
  auction_participants.update(new_dictionary)

# 2) Welcome the user with Gavel Ascii art and a print statement
print(art.logo)
print("Welcome to the secret auction program!")

# 3) We'll us a while loop to continuously add more users to the dictionary
while is_finished == False:
  # 3.1) Ask the user for their name and their bid
  user_name = input("What is your name?: ")
  user_bid = int(input("What is your bid?: $"))

  # 3.2) Add the user's name and bid to the auction participants dictionary by using a function
  add_new_auctioneer(auctioneer=user_name, bid_amount=user_bid)
  print(auction_participants)

  # 3.3) Ask if the user would like to continue with the auction
  continue_auction = input("Are there any other bidders? Type 'Yes' or 'No' \n")
  if continue_auction.lower() == 'yes':
    user_count += 1
    clear()
    continue
  else:
    is_finished = True

# 4) We'll then loop through each key:value pair to know who has the greatest bid
# https://www.askpython.com/python/string/python-string-substring
for key in auction_participants:
  # 4.1) We need to find the values that are integers. We can do so by finding out which values have the same data type as the highest_bid value since highest_bid is an integer
  if type(auction_participants[key]) == type(highest_bid):
    # 4.2) Then, we check to see if the value is greater than highest_bid. If it is, we'll update the highest_bid value
    if auction_participants[key] > highest_bid:
      highest_bid = auction_participants[key]
      # 4.3) This splicing technique retrieves the end number of "bid" and adds it to the "user" key. 
      # After the highest value is found, this if block no longer executes. So, we don't look for more bids
      # After finding the highest value, we add the end number to "user" and then find the value that is under the "user[#]" key. 
      # For example, "bid1":250, "bid2":850 (greatest number in dictionary) -> str(key[3:]) finds "2" from bid2 and adds "2" to "user" -> "user2"
      # bid_winner = auction_participants["user2"] -> This is how we get the bid winner
      # Only works for bids 0 - 9. We'll need another if statement that can handle bids that go above 10 - 99:
      # if int(key[3:4]) >= 10 and <= 99:
      # bid_winner = auction_participants["user" + str(key[3:4])
      # else:
      bid_winner = auction_participants["user" + str(key[3:])]

# 5) Format highest_bid with commas: https://pythonguides.com/python-format-number-with-commas/
highest_bid = "{:,}".format(highest_bid)

# 6) Print out the highest_bid value
print(f"{bid_winner} wins the auction by betting ${highest_bid}!")
