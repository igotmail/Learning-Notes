# Problem: Year is a string that is being used for numerical calculations 
# year = input("Which year do you want to check?")

# Solution: Parse/Cast/Covert year to an integer (Be sure to check if the logic of the program is correct too.)
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))

if year % 4 == 0:
  if year % 100 == 0:
    if year % 400 == 0:
      print("Leap year.")
    else:
      print("Not leap year.")
  else:
    print("Leap year.")
else:
  print("Not leap year.")
